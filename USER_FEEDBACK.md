- Wave Editor: Box to display seconds elapsed between each unit is not clear. After creating a wave, the name of the wave is no longer displayed and thus it is difficult for the user to keep track of the wave he/she created. Nesting waves allows the user to create many different units. Also, there should be the ability to set quantity and default time in between each wave (ie. default time can be set in the "Create Wave" box)
- Tower Editor: Save button should close after press, while the Close button should be a Cancel button.  We got lots of positive feedback on the layout and overall aesthetic appeal on the editor window, so we'll look to recycle that code in other sprite editors we create.
- Map Editor: Tiles are not yet finished but their purpose is not quite clear to the user. While it can be used both for drawing and setting up terrain, some user testers suggested that the tiles could be used to define rudimentary paths as well. This is potentially a good idea, but the path itself would be limited to very rough edges and its detail would be contingent on tile size (although smaller tile size makes it more and more difficult).
- General: There should be a way for the user to select what kind of game they want to play (ie. Free-form pathing, set pathing, and single ground pathing)
- Levels Editor: Not yet finished, but its purpose is also not very clear.
